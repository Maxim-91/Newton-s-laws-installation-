The program contains a Main menu and a context menu. The main menu contains the main and additional functions of the program.

This software product uses a multi-window interface for greater convenience, so as not to clutter the main window for calculations. That is, all windows perform only a certain set function, and saame, that is, the main window is responsible for the entered data, and the report window is responsible for viewing and printing the calculated equations.

Each button or input field in the application contains a tooltip that appears when you move the cursor over it. The hint indicates the role of this button or field in the loan calculation process.

The program contains a well-structured help system, which is also in Ukrainian. It describes in detail all the processes taking place in the program:

The program distribution is provided as a single file packed in a WinRar SFX archive. Extracts to a temporary folder in the background during installation. After that, the process of installing the program on the computer takes place. At the time of installation, an alias is created for the program table, data about the program is entered into the registry, shortcuts are created to launch the program on the desktop and in Start->All programs.
The sequence of steps to install the program is presented below:

The task of this software product is to organize the implementation of virtual laboratory works in physics in grades 10-11. In the educational process of physics, this product acts as a guide to students' actions and as a means of planning their educational activities and monitoring educational achievements.
The content of the PE "Newton's Laws" is developed in full accordance with the current program and the traditional content of teaching physics with some expansion.
Among the pedagogical possibilities of this software product, it should be noted:
1. The possibility of self-training of the student to perform laboratory research;
2. Reduction of time for preparation for performing laboratory work;
3. Formation of indicative bases of activity when performing laboratory research;
4. Self-monitoring of activity results in the process of preparing and performing laboratory tests;
5. Provision of opportunities to obtain information about the physical process and quantitative values ​​of physical quantities.
6. Direct participation of the student in the process of performing laboratory research - interactive models of laboratory work.
With the help of this software product, you can perform all the proposed calculations, print and view the report, use auxiliary blocks. Since all educational institutions are equipped with computers, this would allow teachers to check students' work and students to check their work for errors during homework.
